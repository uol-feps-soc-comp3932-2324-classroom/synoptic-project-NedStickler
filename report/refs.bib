  abstract = {Abstract Super-Resolution reconstruction produces one or a set of high-resolution images from a sequence of low-resolution frames. This article reviews a variety of Super-Resolution methods proposed in the last 20 years, and provides some insight into, and a summary of, our recent contributions to the general Super-Resolution problem. In the process, a detailed study of several very important aspects of Super-Resolution, often ignored in the literature, is presented. Specifically, we discuss robustness, treatment of color, and dynamic operation modes. Novel methods for addressing these issues are accompanied by experimental results on simulated and real data. Finally, some future challenges in Super-Resolution are outlined and discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    abstract = "{This paper provides an overview on super-resolution (SR) research in medical imaging applications. Many imaging modalities exist. Some provide anatomical information and reveal information about the structure of the human body, and others provide functional information, locations of activity for specific activities and specified tasks. Each imaging system has a characteristic resolution, which is determined based on physical constraints of the system detectors that are in turn tuned to signal-to-noise and timing considerations. A common goal across systems is to increase the resolution, and as much as possible achieve true isotropic 3-D imaging. SR technology can serve to advance this goal. Research on SR in key medical imaging modalities, including MRI, fMRI and PET, has started to emerge in recent years and is reviewed herein. The algorithms used are mostly based on standard SR algorithms. Results demonstrate the potential in introducing SR techniques into practical medical applications.}",

abstract = {Super-resolution (SR) technique reconstructs a higher-resolution image or sequence from the observed LR images. As SR has been developed for more than three decades, both multi-frame and single-frame SR have significant applications in our daily life. This paper aims to provide a review of SR from the perspective of techniques and applications, and especially the main contributions in recent years. Regularized SR methods are most commonly employed in the last decade. Technical details are discussed in this article, including reconstruction models, parameter selection methods, optimization algorithms and acceleration strategies. Moreover, an exhaustive summary of the current applications using SR techniques has been presented. Lastly, the article discusses the current obstacles for future research.}
