I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr Duygu Sarikaya, for providing guidance for the duration of the project, and my assessor, Dr Dibyayan Chakraborty, for the feedback provided.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my friend and peer, Alex Francis, for the encouragement and advice offered throughout the project, and for delving into the field of deep learning alongside me.
