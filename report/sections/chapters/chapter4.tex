<Everything that comes under the `Results and Discussion' criterion in the mark scheme that has not been addressed in an earlier chapter should be included in this final chapter. The following section headings are suggestions only.>

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Individual model performance}

\subsection{Remote sensing specialisation}

\subsection{Improving loss}

\subsection{Addressing our conjecture}

\subsection{Noise and artefacts}

\subsection{Visual quality and MOS}

\subsection{Project Goals}

\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Ideas for future work}
Improved training with: more training iterations, a larger batch size, full training dataset

Train a classifier on the dataset beforehand

<Results and discussion requirements. Is it clear that\dots
\begin{itemize}
    \item Appropriate tests and evaluation were conducted and analysed to validate the quality of deliverables withihn the remit of the project?
    \item There are objective criteria for evaluating the achievement of the projects against the inital problem?
    \item These criteria are justified?
    \item The criteria have been used professionally to judge whether the problem has been solved?
\end{itemize}
