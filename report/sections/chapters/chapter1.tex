Super-resolution image reconstruction describes the task of approximating a high-resolution representation of a low-resolution image~\cite{superResOverview}. SR image reconstruction is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision with many proposed solutions due to the ill-posed nature of the task: there are many `correct' HR representations of a single LR image. This project will overview approaches to the problem and explore state-of-the-art generative deep learning-based solutions.

SR image reconstruction is utilized in many domains, including but not limited to\dots
