\section{Introduction}

<A brief introduction suitable for a non-specialist, {\em i.e.} without using technical terms or jargon, as far as possible. This may be similar/the same as that in the 'Outline and Plan' document. The remainder of this chapter will normally cover everything to be assessed under the `Background Research` criterion in the mark scheme.>

Here is an example of how to cite a reference using the numeric system \cite{parikh1980adaptive}.

Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision. Super-resolution (SR) reconstrution is the process where high-resolution (HR) imagery is generated from a low-resolution (LR) input, with the aim of better capturing the image features (ref). SISR presents a unique challenge due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. One LR image has many SR outputs that would be considered correct. A result of this phenomenon is many proposed solutions. 

We can group exisiting approaches into three categories: interpolation-, reconstrution- and learning-based approaches (ref).

% Must provide evidence of a literature review. Use sections
% and subsections as they make sense for your project.
\section{Literature review}
<This section heading is purely a suggestion -- you should subdivide this chapter in whatever manner you think makes most sense for your project. It may also make sense to spread the `Background Research' over more than one chapter, in which case they should be named sensibly.>

    \item Super resolution methods
    \item Deep learning methods
    \item GAN methods
