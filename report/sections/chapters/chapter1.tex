Super-resolution image reconstruction describes the task of estimating a high-resolution representation of a low-resolution image~\cite{superResOverview}. SR image reconstruction is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision due to the ill-posed nature of the task: there are many `correct' HR representations of a single LR image~\cite{superResChallenges}. This project will overview approaches to the problem, explore state-of-the-art generative deep learning-based solutions, and suggest alterations to previous works.

SR image reconstruction is utilized in many domains, including remote sensing, medical imaging~\cite{superResMedicalImaging}, surveillance, astronomy, and more~\cite{superResUses}.
